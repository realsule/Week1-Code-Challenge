# Week1-Code-Challenge

Three JavaScript programs that solve different programming challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

## Description

This repository contains three separate JavaScript solutions for different programming challenges:

1. **Student Grade Generator**: Calculates student grades based on marks
2. **Speed Detector**: Checks vehicle speed and calculates demerit points
3. **Net Salary Calculator**: Calculates net salary with Kenyan tax deductions

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
A program that prompts the user to input student marks (0-100) and outputs the correct grade based on:
- A > 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 49 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
A program that takes vehicle speed as input and:
- Prints "Ok" if speed is less than 70 km/h
- Calculates demerit points (1 point for every 5 km/h above 70)
- Prints "License suspended" if points exceed 12

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
A program that calculates an individual's net salary based on basic salary and benefits, including:
- Gross salary calculation
- PAYE (Tax) according to KRA 2023 rates
- NHIF deductions
- NSSF deductions
- Net salary calculation

Uses official KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values for accurate calculations.
